# ISO 14064 Compliance

Guide for greenhouse gas reporting under ISO 14064-1:2018.

## What is ISO 14064?

[ISO 14064](https://www.iso.org/standard/66453.html) is the international standard for quantifying and reporting greenhouse gas emissions. It provides detailed requirements for organizational-level GHG inventories.

ISO 14064 has three parts:
- **Part 1**: Organization-level quantification and reporting
- **Part 2**: Project-level quantification and reporting
- **Part 3**: Verification and validation

The Green module supports **Part 1** requirements.

## Key Requirements

### Organizational Boundary

Define which operations are included:

```
Organizational boundary: Operational control
Included: AI inference API usage by [Organization]
Excluded: Direct operations (reported separately)
```

### Operational Boundary

Specify emission sources:

```
Scope 3, Category 1: Purchased goods and services
Source: AI inference API calls
Activity: Token processing (input, output, cache)
```

### Base Year

Establish reference point for tracking:

```bash
openclaw green targets:add \
  --name "Base Year Inventory" \
  --base-year 2025 \
  --target-year 2030 \
  --reduction 0
```

The base year inventory captures emissions at a fixed point.

## Uncertainty Quantification

ISO 14064 requires uncertainty assessment. OpenClaw calculates uncertainty from confidence scores:

| Confidence | Uncertainty Range |
|------------|-------------------|
| ≥70% | ±15% |
| ≥50% | ±30% |
| ≥30% | ±50% |
| <30% | ±100% |

View uncertainty:

```bash
openclaw green intensity
```

Output includes uncertainty range.

## Export Format

ISO 14064 doesn't prescribe a specific format. Use TCFD export with additional metadata:

```bash
openclaw green export --format tcfd --period 2025 --baseline 2024
```

Add ISO 14064-specific fields manually:

```json
{
  "standard": "ISO 14064-1:2018",
  "reportingPeriod": {
    "start": "2025-01-01",
    "end": "2025-12-31"
  },
  "organizationalBoundary": {
    "approach": "operational_control",
    "entities": ["[Organization name]"]
  },
  "operationalBoundary": {
    "scope3": {
      "category1": {
        "included": true,
        "sources": ["AI inference API calls"]
      }
    }
  },
  "quantificationMethodology": {
    "method": "calculation",
    "activityData": "API token counts",
    "emissionFactors": "Academic research (Lacoste et al. 2019)",
    "globalWarmingPotentials": "IPCC AR6"
  },
  "uncertainty": {
    "method": "confidence-based",
    "overallUncertainty_percent": 30
  },
  "emissions": {
    "scope3Cat1_tCO2eq": 0.01245,
    "uncertainty_tCO2eq": 0.00374
  }
}
```

## Uncertainty Methodology

### Calculation

```
Uncertainty (%) = f(confidence)

where:
  confidence ≥ 0.7 → ±15%
  confidence ≥ 0.5 → ±30%
  confidence ≥ 0.3 → ±50%
  confidence < 0.3 → ±100%
```

### Reporting

Express emissions with uncertainty:

```
12.45 kg CO₂eq ± 3.74 kg (±30%)
```

Or as range:

```
8.72 - 16.19 kg CO₂eq (95% confidence interval)
```

## Documentation Requirements

ISO 14064 requires extensive documentation:

### 1. GHG Management Plan

```markdown
## AI Emissions Management

### Scope
AI inference emissions from API usage.

### Responsibility
[Role] responsible for data collection and reporting.

### Frequency
Quarterly calculation, annual reporting.

### Data Sources
- API usage logs (token counts)
- Provider invoices (validation)
- OpenClaw Green module (calculation)
```

### 2. Quantification Methodology

```markdown
## Quantification Methodology

### Activity Data
Token counts (input, output, cache) from API responses.

### Emission Factors
Per-model factors from academic research:
- Lacoste et al. (2019)
- Patterson et al. (2022)
- CodeCarbon project

### Calculation
CO₂ = Σ(tokens × factor_per_token)

### Global Warming Potentials
IPCC AR6 (CO₂ = 1, no other gases for inference)
```

### 3. Uncertainty Assessment

```markdown
## Uncertainty Assessment

### Sources of Uncertainty
1. Emission factors (±25%) - no supplier data
2. Activity data (±5%) - API logs accurate
3. Model mapping (±10%) - model aliases

### Combined Uncertainty
±30% (root sum of squares)

### Limitations
- No supplier-specific data
- Data center PUE assumed
- Grid carbon intensity averaged
```

## Verification Readiness

For third-party verification under ISO 14064-3:

### Evidence to Provide

1. **Raw data**: `openclaw green export --format json`
2. **Summary**: `openclaw green export --format tcfd`
3. **Methodology**: Link to this documentation
4. **Factor sources**: Academic papers
5. **Activity logs**: API usage records

### Verification Statement

```
The GHG inventory for AI inference emissions has been verified
to a limited/reasonable level of assurance in accordance with
ISO 14064-3:2019.

Scope: Scope 3, Category 1 emissions from AI inference API usage
Period: January 1 - December 31, 2025
Emissions: 12.45 kg CO₂eq ± 30%
```

## Continuous Improvement

ISO 14064 emphasizes continuous improvement:

1. **Annual review** of emission factors
2. **Engage providers** for better data
3. **Reduce uncertainty** through measurement
4. **Set targets** for emission reduction
5. **Track progress** against base year
